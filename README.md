## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to learn C++ through game programming. I will be following along with the examples and exercises presented in the book "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming" by Michael Dawson. The project will include the code and projects I create while working through the book.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GNU Compiler Collection - g++)
- [Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

## Course Outline

The course is divided into several chapters, covering different aspects of C++ game programming. Here's a brief outline of what to expect:

1. **Introduction to C++: Guess My Number Game**
   - A brief introduction to C++ programming language and a simple "Guess My Number" game project.

2. **Working with Variables and Constants: Monster Attack Game**
   - Understanding how to declare and use variables and constants in C++.
   - Building a "Monster Attack" game project.

3. **Understanding Arrays and Strings: Word Jumble Game**
   - Working with arrays and strings in C++ to store and manipulate data.
   - Creating a "Word Jumble" game project.

4. **Implementing Expressions, Decisions, and Loops: High-Low Game**
   - Learning about expressions, decision-making with conditionals, and loops.
   - Developing a "High-Low" game project.

5. **Creating Functions in C++: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - Writing functions to modularize code and enhance code reusability.
   - Constructing a "Tic-Tac-Toe" game project.

6. **Introducing Object-Oriented Programming: BattleShip Game**
   - Getting started with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++.
   - Designing a "BattleShip" game project.

7. **Extending Classes and Inheritance: Hand Cricket Game**
   - Understanding class inheritance and extending class functionalities.
   - Implementing a "Hand Cricket" game project.

8. **Working with Polymorphism and Abstract Classes: Slot Machine Game**
   - Exploring polymorphism and abstract classes for flexible object behavior.
   - Creating a "Slot Machine" game project.

9. **Understanding File I/O: Hangman Game**
   - Working with file input/output operations in C++.
   - Building a "Hangman" game project.

10. **Building Simple Games: Blackjack Game**
    - Putting everything together to create simple games using C++.
    - Developing a "Blackjack" game project.

## Progress

I will update this section regularly to keep track of my progress throughout the course. Feel free to check out the code and projects as I move through the chapters.
