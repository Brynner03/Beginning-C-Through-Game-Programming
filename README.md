## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to learn C++ through game programming. I will be following along with the examples and exercises presented in the book "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming" by Michael Dawson. The project will include the code and projects I create while working through the book.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GNU Compiler Collection - g++)
- [Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

## Course Outline

The course is divided into several chapters, covering different aspects of C++ game programming. Here's a brief outline of what to expect:

1. Introduction to C++
2. Working with Variables and Constants
3. Understanding Arrays and Strings
4. Implementing Expressions, Decisions, and Loops
5. Creating Functions in C++
6. Introducing Object-Oriented Programming
7. Extending Classes and Inheritance
8. Working with Polymorphism and Abstract Classes
9. Understanding File I/O
10. Building Simple Games

## Progress

I will update this section regularly to keep track of my progress throughout the course. Feel free to check out the code and projects as I move through the chapters.
